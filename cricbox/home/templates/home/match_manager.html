        <h1>Match Manager Duties</h1>
        <p>Friendly match:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If it's artificial, we need springback stumps - contact Troy (07786 393 710) to arrange collection.</li>
            <li>Away match? Contact Troy to arrange collection of backpack – this has everything you need.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>Get the key from the rangers.</li>

            </li>
            <li>Remove ropes from pitch. These must go back after the match – it is not the park rangers’ duty.</li>
            <li>Collect and position scoreboard, flags (if needed), and wickets – please use the stump gauge; don’t
                flatten the top of the stumps.
            </li>
            <li>Ensure the kit and equipment go back to where they are stored and lock it all up. Lock up shed and
                return key to the Rangers.
            </li>
            <li>Collect match fees on the day (cash or electronic proof). This may also involve collecting match fees
