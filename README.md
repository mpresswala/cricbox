# London Fields website
This Django project has been created for storing statistics, information and reports for a cricket club.

## Quick start

The django application is broken down into the following individual apps.

Theoretically this structure can be reused across any clubs with a similar format without much changes.

    batsman
    bowler
    home
    match
    match_statistics
    opposition
    player
    venue

Detailed documentation is in the "docs" directory.
